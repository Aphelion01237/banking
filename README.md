# banking

1) This project was about banking and calculating interest rates on deposits and using multiple files to set up C++ classes

2) I think I did formatting particularly well here, it looks clean.

3) I could probably refactor my code to make it smaller and use less lines.

4) The most challenging part was setting up the look with a text format, I really miss being able to very specifically alter that with HTML and CSS. I used a lot of trial and error to make things look nice.

5) I think figuring out how to make command prompt output for simple programs is a pretty useful skill, so I would say that it particularly transferrable for anything without a GUI.

6) I made this program maintainable/readable/adaptable by using comments and describing what is going on
